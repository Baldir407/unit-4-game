# unit-4-game "Crystal Clicker!"

## Introduction
This simple jQuery game was made using the example shown during UCF Coding Bootcamp. Upon visiting the page, the user will be greeted
by the title of the game, the rules of the game, and a set of four gems for them to click. On every refresh of the page, a different
number will be generated on screen. Each gem will have a random value assigned to it. The goal is click on each gem until the number is
reached. Upon reaching said number, the user is given a win. If the user goes over the number, they will be given a loss.
